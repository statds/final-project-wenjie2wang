  The classical survival models, such as Cox proportional hazard model, often
  require extensive efforts on variable selection or prior medical information

# Introduction and Objects {#sec:intro}


For survival data, medical researchers' interests often lie in discovery of
significant treatment effects and important diagnosis covariates of patients.
The classical survival models, such as Cox proportional hazard model, assume
risk function in a simple linear form of covariates, which can be too simplistic
to capture the underlying relationship between response and covariates.  In
addition, they often require extensive efforts on variable selection or prior
medical information to model interaction between patients' covariates and
treatment covariates.  While nonlinear models, such as neural networks and
random forests, are able to model high-order interaction terms. It is of
interest to apply these machine learning methods to survival data and compare
their performance with classical statistical models. It would be even more
interesting to discover nonlinear relationship by machine learning methods and
build a statistical model for better interpretation and capability for
statistical inferences.


The specific objectives include:

- Explore and review existing machine methods for survival data including random
  forests and deep neural networks.

- Apply these methods for CT suicidal data.

- Compare the out-of-sample model fitting or prediction performance of these
  methods with classical survival models, such as Cox model.
