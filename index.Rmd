## Introduction

- Medical researchers' interests often lie in estimating treatment effects and
  discovery of important diagnosis covariates of patients.
- classical survival models (e.g., Cox PH model)
  - simply assumes linear risk function
  - require extensive efforts on variable selection to model interaction
- "State-of-the-art" models allows nonlinear risk function and are able to
  model high-order interaction terms.
   - deep neural networks [@katzman2016arxiv]
   - random survival forests [@ishwaran2008aoas]

## CT Suicide Death Data

- The subjects in the CT suicide death data were patients who have been
  hospitalized for suicide attempt or intentional self-injury during
  fiscal year 2005 to 2012.

- A total of 22,221 patients were followed up until September 30, 2012.  Among
  them, 16,208 (73\%) were white (9,108 female and 7,100 male) and 6,013
  (27\%) were non-white (3,220 female and 2,793 male). The number of event
  (suicidal death) was only 606 and thus the censoring rate was about 97.3\%.

- We are interested in the time since hospitalization due to suicide attempts
  to suicidal death of those patients.

## Random Survival Forest (RSF)

- @ishwaran2008aoas extended random forest method [@breiman2001ml] to random
  survival forests (RSF) method for analysis of right-censored survival data.
  1. draw $B$ bootstrap samples from the origin data
  2. grow a survival tree with randomly selecting $p$ candidate covariates at
     each node and maximizing survival difference between daughter nodes
  3. each terminal node: no less than $d_0 > 0$ unique deaths
  4. compute cumulative hazard function (CHF) for each tree and average to
     obtain the ensemble CHF
  5. compute prediction error using out-of-bag data
- existing implementation in R: **randomForestSRC**


## Deep Neural Network (DeepSurv)

- @katzman2016arxiv proposed a Cox proportional hazards deep neural network
  method called *DeepSurv*, a multi-layer perceptron predicting event risk.
- The loss function is set to be the negative log partial likelihood
  [@cox1975biometrika].
- allows more than one layer and outputs a single node estimating the relative
  risk function $\hat{r}_{\theta}$ by the weights of the network $\theta$
- weight decay (L2-norm) regularization, Rectified Linear Units (ReLU) with
  batch normalization [@ioffe2015icml], dropout [@srivastava2014jmlr], etc.
- existing implementation in Python: **DeepSurv**


## Application to CT suicide data

- estimated prediction performance with Harrell's concordance index
  [@harrell1996sim] with 200 random splits
- @ishwaran2010jasa proposed an algorithm named "RSF-Variable Hunting" for
  high-dimensional variable selection for survival data.


## Prediction Performance

```{r boxplot-c-index, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("www/img/boxplot_c-index.png")
```

## Important Covaraites

- length of stay
- age
- gender (male vs. female)
- race (white vs. non-white)
- ICD-9 categories:
  - 305: nondependent abuse of drugs
  - 881: open wound of elbow forearm and wrist
  - 304: drug dependence
  - 303: alcohol dependence syndrome
  - 965: poisoning by analgesics antipyretics and antirheumatics
  - ...

## Future Work

- turn the hyperparameters for deep neural network model with random
  hyper-parameter optimization search [@bergstra2012jmlr]
- @dazard2018sagmb proposed a RSF-based pairwise interaction estimator to
  reveal pairwise interaction-effects.
  - R package named `r a_new("IRSF", "https://github.com/jedazard/IRSF")`
    under development at GitHub
- ...


## Reproducibility with Docker

- `r a_new("Docker", "https://www.docker.com")` is a platform that allows you
  to "build, ship, run any app, anywhere".
  - initially released as open source in March 2013

## Docker image

- A Docker image for this project is publicly available at Docker Hub:
  `r a_new("https://hub.docker.com/r/wenjie2wang/statds-spring2018/")`

- pull it by the following command

```bash
$ docker pull wenjie2wang/statds-spring2018
```

- We may run the docker image as a docker container

```bash
$ docker run -it -p 6006:6006 --rm wenjie2wang/statds-spring2018:latest
```

- Demo
